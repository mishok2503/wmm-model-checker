In TSO, each thread sees its own records before other threads do

1) In TSO, it is guaranteed that if a thread has written x = 1 itself,
it will surely see x = 1 when it loads it

2) Similarly, another thread, having written y = 1, should immediately see y = 1

3) If r10 == 1 but r11 == 0, it means that another thread has not seen the entry y = 1
although x = 1 has already become visible, which is forbidden in TSO. In this case the test
goes to fail
